# meet-supporter
A Chrome extension that enhances your experience during Google Meet meetings.

# How it Works

## Auto Mute Mic and Cam
When you enter the lobby of a meeting, Google Meet automatically activates your mic and camera. This extension will automatically mute your mic and turn off your camera for you.

## Highlight Muted Mic
It's easy to forget to unmute when you need to speak. The extension makes the meeting background turn red when your mic is muted, providing a clear visual reminder.

## Auto Leave Listening Sessions
For meetings where you're just listening, you might leave your computer for a few moments while using Bluetooth headphones. The extension helps avoid the embarrassment of staying in a meeting that's over by automatically leaving when the meeting has more than 6 people and half of the participants have already left.
